## Introduction

This project aims to bridge the gap between advancements in text-based model optimization and the domain of visual data, by applying the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework to the ImageReward dataset. This novel application challenges the adaptability of text-oriented optimization methods to the complexities of visual data interpretation and sets the stage for a potential breakthrough in multimodal AI research.

## Motivation

The inspiration for this project comes from the pursuit of human-aligned artificial intelligence, as evidenced by the innovative works presented at NeurIPS 2023. The DPO framework, known for its stability, efficiency, and computational simplicity, is being adapted for use in image preference alignment, venturing into the less chartered territory of enhancing text-to-image models with human preference data.
